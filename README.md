Auto Feeder Helmet
Keeping you saturated!

Auto Feeder Helmet is a Minecraft mod for version 1.12.2 that adds a simple way off staying saturated.

This is done by a simple item called "Helmet Feeding Module", which can easily be crafted in early game.
Once crafted you put it into a crafting grid with any helmet (modded or vanilla)
and it will show "Auto feeding mode" in its GUI:

Any helmet with this trait will automatically consume any food items in your inventory when you are hungry.
This way you will never have to deal with eating again,  just make sure to always have some food with you.
